## Deployment
View the website here: https://gspuniani.github.io/TeleLegal-Winter-Intensive/. 

## Purpose
TeleLegal remotely and securely connects Attorneys to Potential Clients across the State of California. Attorneys utilizing TeleLegal’s services gain access to a pool of California citizens with specific and often urgent legal questions. Either the Attorney or a Potential Client can initiate a text chat with the other as part of the initial consultation. The Attorney and Potential Client can then agree to enter a video chat to further discuss the case particulars and complete the consultation. During or after this video call, the Attorney and Potential Client--if they decide to proceed forward with the matter--may exchange additional contact information and negotiate between themselves a reasonable fee agreement. Many “routine” services, such as drafting a simple will or reviewing a standard contract, may be offered at a flat rate. Attorneys who sign up will also have access to the TeleLegal Community, a forum for lawyers to share useful practice tips with each other.
